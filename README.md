Title: Machine Learning for Assisted Living:
Detecting Behavioral and Postural Changes in Patient
Monitoring

We present a novel approach to human activity detection and prediction that integrates change point detection with activity modeling. The proposed methodology focuses on identifying transitions between activities in real-time while accounting for noise in sensor data. Additionally, a tolerance-based pattern matching mechanism is utilized to predict future activities, ensuring robustness against variations and gradual shifts in activity sequences. This comprehensive framework aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of human activity recognition systems.

Our approach integrates change point detection techniques with activity modeling to identify significant deviations from typical behavior and manage noise in sensor data through adaptive thresholds. The system achieved a high accuracy of 96%, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in recognizing activities and detecting transitions in real-time. Additionally, the integration of change point detection significantly enhanced activity identification and reduced false positives, improving overall system performance. By offering timely interventions through automatic alerts, our framework not only improves patient safety but also alleviates caregiver workload, providing a scalable and efficient solution for assisted living environments.
