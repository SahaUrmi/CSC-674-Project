# CSC-674-Project

We present a novel approach to human activity detection and prediction that integrates change point detection with activity modeling. The proposed methodology focuses on identifying transitions between activities in real-time while accounting for noise in sensor data. Additionally, a tolerance-based pattern matching mechanism is utilized to predict future activities, ensuring robustness against variations and gradual shifts in activity sequences. This comprehensive framework aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of human activity recognition systems.
